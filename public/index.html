    <p>
      What exactly is wakeSurfing? wakesurfing is a water sport, where you are
      pulled behind a boat, while riding a board, then you throw the rope back
      inside the boat and surf the wake created by the boat.

    <h2 class="Heading">Why I enjoy wakesurfing</h2>
    <p>
      As a child I grew up wakeboarding. By the age of 15, the impact caused by
      the force of jumping on a wakeboard was causing injuries to my lower back.
      As an alternative, I decided to start wakesurfing. WakeSurfing is far less
      impact and in my opinion just as fun.
